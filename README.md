  "file_id": "9bda7e1e-da43-408e-8a87-ee770b043ec2",
  "message": "File uploaded and encrypted successfully!",
  "expires_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

### Download File

**POST** `/download/{file_id}`

Download and decrypt a previously uploaded file.

**Path Parameters:**
- `file_id`: UUID of the uploaded file

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "password": "your-encryption-password"
}
```

- **Error**: JSON error message

### Health Check

**GET** `/health`

Check server status and uptime.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "service": "rustshare",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-14T10:30:00Z"
}
```

## 🔐 Security Features

### Encryption Implementation

**Algorithm**: AES-256-GCM (Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data)
- **Key Size**: 256 bits (32 bytes) for maximum security
- **Authentication**: Built-in with GCM mode
- **Key Derivation**: PBKDF2 with 100,000 iterations
- **Salt**: 16-byte random salt per file
- **Nonce**: 12-byte random nonce per encryption

### Security Architecture

```rust
// Key derivation from rustshare/src/main.rs
const PBKDF2_ITERATIONS: u32 = 100_000;
const KEY_SIZE: usize = 32;        // AES-256
const NONCE_SIZE: usize = 12;      // GCM standard
const SALT_SIZE: usize = 16;       // 128-bit salt
```

**File Security:**
- Files never stored in plaintext
- Automatic expiration (24 hours)
- Unique UUID naming prevents enumeration
- Size limits prevent resource exhaustion

<form enctype="multipart/form-data">
    <input type="file" name="file" required>
    <input type="password" name="password" required>
    <button type="submit">🔒 Upload & Encrypt</button>
</form>
```

### API Usage
```bash
# Upload file
curl -X POST -F "file=@document.pdf" -F "password=mypassword123" \
  https://future-cs-03-b8iu.onrender.com/upload

# Download file
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"password":"mypassword123"}' \
  https://future-cs-03-b8iu.onrender.com/download/file-uuid \
  --output downloaded-file.pdf
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist

- ✅ File upload with various formats (PDF, images, text)
- ✅ Password protection (correct/incorrect passwords)
- ✅ File size limits (test 10MB+ files)
- ✅ File expiration after 24 hours
- ✅ Mobile responsive interface
- ✅ Concurrent upload handling

### Automated Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
cargo test

# Test encryption functions
cargo test encrypt
cargo test decrypt
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Upload Fails**
- Check file size (must be ≤ 10MB)
- Verify password complexity
- Ensure stable internet connection

**Download Issues**
- Confirm File ID is correct (UUID format)
- Check password matches exactly
- Verify file hasn't expired (24h limit)

**Local Development**
- Ensure Rust 1.70+ is installed
- Check port 8080 availability
- Verify templates/ directory exists

### Debug Mode

```bash
RUST_LOG=debug cargo run
```
